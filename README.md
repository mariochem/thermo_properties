This repository contains programs to assist in projects involving calculations of chemical processes and calculations of energy production.

The agua.cpp program calculates the properties of saturated water vapor given the temperature. The properties that are calculated in the present version are as follows:

  <p>1 - Steam Pressure in kpa at a given temperature in celsius.<p>
  <p>2 - Specific volume of the saturated liquid in m3 / kg at a given temperature in celsius.<p>
  <p>3 - Specific volume of saturated steam in m3 / kg at a given temperature in celsius.<p>
  4 - Enthalpy of the saturated liquid in kJ / kg at a given temperature in celsius.<p>
  5 - Enthalpy of saturated steam in kJ / kg at a given temperature in celsius.<p>
  6 - Entropy of the saturated liquid in kJ / kg * K at a given temperature in celsius.<p>
  7 - Entropy of saturated steam in kJ / kg * K at a given temperature in celsius.<p>
  8 - Enthalpy of evaporation of liquid water in kJ / kg at a given temperature in celsius.<p>
  9 - Entropy of evaporation of liquid water in kJ / kg * K at a given temperature in celsius.<p>
10 - Internal energy of water vapor in kJ / kg at a given temperature in celsius.<p>
11 - Internal energy liquid water in kJ / kg at a given temperature in celsius.<p>
12 - Internal energy of water evaporation in kJ / kg at a given temperature in celsius.<p>

To perform the calculation of properties in the saturation state that are within the temperature range between **0** to **374.14 ÂºC**, use the following procedures:
