This repository contains programs to assist in projects involving calculations of chemical processes and calculations of energy production.

The agua.cpp program calculates the properties of saturated water vapor given the temperature. The properties that are calculated in the present version are as follows:

  1 - Steam Pressure in kpa at a given temperature in celsius.
  2 - Specific volume of the saturated liquid in m3 / kg at a given temperature in celsius.
  3 - Specific volume of saturated steam in m3 / kg at a given temperature in celsius.
  4 - Enthalpy of the saturated liquid in kJ / kg at a given temperature in celsius.
  5 - Enthalpy of saturated steam in kJ / kg at a given temperature in celsius.
  6 - Entropy of the saturated liquid in kJ / kg * K at a given temperature in celsius.
  7 - Entropy of saturated steam in kJ / kg * K at a given temperature in celsius.
  8 - Enthalpy of evaporation of liquid water in kJ / kg at a given temperature in celsius.
  9 - Entropy of evaporation of liquid water in kJ / kg * K at a given temperature in celsius.
10 - Internal energy of water vapor in kJ / kg at a given temperature in celsius.
11 - Internal energy liquid water in kJ / kg at a given temperature in celsius.
12 - Internal energy of water evaporation in kJ / kg at a given temperature in celsius.

To perform the calculation of properties in the saturation state that are within the temperature range between 0 to 374.14 ÂºC, use the following procedures:

1 - instantiate an object to have access to all the calculation functions present for water, in this case the water object was instantiated.

2 - From there you can use the following functions:
      a - water.pv (xd, yd) this function calculates the vapor pressure at a given temperature in celcius that must be entered in xd.
The function returns an integer 0 or 1 to inform whether the temperature is within the range of the table. The variable yd reports the value obtained for the steam pressure in kpa.

      b - water.vl (xd, yd) this function calculates the specific volume of liquid water in the saturation condition. The temperature in celsius must be entered in xd.
The function returns an integer 0 or 1 to inform whether the temperature is within the range of the table. The variable yd informs the value obtained for the specific volume in m3 / kg.

      c - water.vv (xd, yd) this function calculates the specific volume of water vapor in the saturation condition. The temperature in celsius must be entered in xd.
The function returns an integer 0 or 1 to inform whether the temperature is within the range of the table. The variable yd informs the value obtained for the specific volume in m3 / kg.

      d - water.hl (xd, yd) This function calculates the enthalpy of liquid water in the saturation condition. The temperature in celsius must be entered in xd.
The function returns an integer 0 or 1 to inform whether the temperature is within the range of the table. The variable yd informs the value obtained for the enthalpy of liquid water in kJ / kg.

      e - water.hv (xd, yd) this function calculates the enthalpy of water vapor in the saturation condition. The temperature in celsius must be entered in xd.
The function returns an integer 0 or 1 to inform whether the temperature is within the range of the table. The variable yd reports the value obtained for the enthalpy of water vapor in kJ / kg.

      f - water.sl (xd, yd) This function calculates the entropy of liquid water in the saturation condition. The temperature in celsius must be entered in xd.
The function returns an integer 0 or 1 to inform whether the temperature is within the range of the table. The variable yd reports the value obtained for the entropy of liquid water in kJ / kg.

      g - water.sv (xd, yd) this function calculates the entropy of the water vapor in the saturation condition. The temperature in celsius must be entered in xd.
The function returns an integer 0 or 1 to inform whether the temperature is within the range of the table. The variable yd reports the value obtained for the entropy of water vapor in kJ / kg.
