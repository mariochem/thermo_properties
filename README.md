# thermo_properties

This repository contains programs to assist in projects involving calculations of chemical processes and calculations of energy production.

The agua.cpp program calculates the properties of saturated water vapor given the temperature. The properties that are calculated in the present version are as follows:

  1 - Steam Pressure at a given temperature.
  2 - Specific volume of the saturated liquid at a given temperature.
  3 - Specific volume of saturated steam at a given temperature.
  4 - Enthalpy of the saturated liquid at a given temperature.
  5 - Enthalpy of saturated steam at a given temperature.
  6 - Entropy of the saturated liquid at a given temperature.
  7 - Entropy of saturated steam at a given temperature.
  8 - Enthalpy of evaporation of liquid water at a given temperature.
  9 - Entropy of evaporation of liquid water at a given temperature.
10 - Internal energy of water vapor at a given temperature.
11 - Internal energy liquid water at a given temperature.
12 - Internal energy of water evaporation at a given temperature.
